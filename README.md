The [nest.yt](https://nest.yt) offers a dotnet core application platform as a service (PaaS).

The _Nester Deploy_ handles deploying and managing apps on [nest.yt](https://nest.yt) PaaS. It uses the Nest API to manage various tasks. The application can be used by anyone to easily manage their **[Microsoft Dotnet Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)** application on the cloud.  

The source code can be used as it is or customized to suit the needs of the individual or the organization.  


## Nest Taxonomy

| Tree               | Represents a server at a data center.                        |
| Nest               | Represents a the hive that holds user content.               |
| Twig               | Represents a script that creates a Nest structure            |
| Pillow             | Represents a container that holds computing resources.       |

## Server Features

Each server (Tree) is a dedicated server with its own static IP address. The server is automatically backed up each night. The Oak Tree (server group) are Vultr servers based at various data centers (Forests) around the globe. 

## Deployment Locations

The Oak Tree servers exist in the following Forests. A Homestead can be built in any of these locations.  

| Country                                | City           | Forest                      |
